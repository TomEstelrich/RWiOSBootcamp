## Description
The Capstone project is the last journey into the bootcamp, it's expected to be a **fully functional app done in a single week** where each student can show the concepts learnt in the course. 

Space Xploration **is based on the Space X company and provides information about theirs missions and company sections, notifying users when then next mission is due and showing a video of the entire mission.** Itâ€™s completely written in Swift and SwiftUI and I used the MVVM design pattern. The app uses multiple Apple frameworks in addition to Kingfisher that takes care of the image fetching process.

The app is divided in **two parts: missions and sections.** On the first tab you can find a list of upcoming missions and 2 time references. The red view is a countdown of the next mission and the gray one is a reference since the last completed mission. At the same those missions can be filtered by Upcoming or completed, being upcoming the default. Each mission has a **reminder button and shows the date, name, rocket, flight number and the success of the mission** on the compact view. 

Tapping on the circle next to the title presents some **additional information including a video feed for completed launches.** The icon that appears on the left side of the title is the official mission patch that the astronauts were on their suits.

In the **Sections tab the information is shown by a horizontal tabview for each section.** Once you tap on a rocket for example a detail view is presented with all the information regarding this rocket. On the crew details view for instance the user finds a field called more information, that presents additional details from wikipedia in an external browser.

Finally we have mission launchpads and landpads with their respective details and showing a map of their location. Those **maps have been generated by using UIViewRepresentable in order to import MapKit into SwiftUI.**
