# Ray Wenderlich iOS Bootcamp \[Summer 2020]

### Name 
Bartolome Estelrich

### Discord name
TC: Bartolome Estelrich \[*BEstelrich#0357*]

### Location
Toronto [Canada]

### Programming experience
Over two years ago I wrote, in Swift, my first line of code. Around 6 months later I released an app on AppStore [**Toronto2Do**](https://apps.apple.com/app/toronto2do/id1258574300). Since then I've been adding additional features to my app and used it as a motivation to keep learning Swift. Nowadays I'm working hard to learn as much as possible in order to get my first job in this field.

### Goals
Switching careers from an Architecture and Design background to a full-time iOS Developer position.

### Hobbies
Technology, Photography, Home automation and Futuristic movies.
